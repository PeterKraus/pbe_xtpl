  abstract = {Fluorescence EEM spectroscopy accurately quantifies the decomposition of scintillator liquid following exposure to 365 nm light.           ,                             The thermal, oxidative and photochemical stability of the scintillator liquid proposed for the SNO+ experiment has been tested experimentally using accelerated aging methods. The stability of the scintillator constituents was determined through fluorescence excitation emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy and absorption spectroscopy, using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) as an multivariate analysis tool. By exposing the scintillator liquid to a well-known photon flux at 365 nm and by measuring the decay rate of the fluorescence shifters and the formation rate of their photochemical degradation products, we can place an upper limit on the acceptable photon flux as 1.38 {$\pm$} 0.09 \texttimes{} 10               -11               photon mol L               -1               . Similarly, the oxidative stability of the scintillator liquid was determined by exposure to air at several elevated temperatures. Through measurement of the corresponding activation energy it was determined that the average oxygen concentration would have to be kept below 4.3\textendash 7.1 ppb               w               (headspace partial pressure below 24 ppm               v               ). On the other hand, the thermal stability of the scintillator cocktail in the absence of light and oxygen was remarkable and poses no concern to the SNO+ experiment.},

The Complete Basis Set (CBS) limit is estimated by extrapolating the hybrid density functional theory and PT2 energies using extrapolation functions including exponential, inverse power, modified exponential, and the combination of the these functions. We found that the combination of B2KPLYP/cc-pV[D|T]Z (which is the extrapolation based on the energies calculated in cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ) gives results in quadruple-f quality. However, if we want to reach the \$2 kcal/mol chemical accuracy limit, the cc-pV[T|Q]Z is required. Similar results with various extrapolation functions obtained, because the IB parameters were determined by minimizing the averaged mean unsigned error of the calculated databases. We generalized the IB set extrapolation to include more than two basis sets, but we found that extrapolation with two basis sets is satisfactory to give reasonable results. The largest error occurred in the databases of the electron affinities and the weak interactions between the noble gas and the nonpolar molecules. We expect that performing the DHDF-IB scheme with the basis sets augmented by diffuse basis functions will further improve the results.},

These papers focused on the ability of the correlation consistent and other basis sets to reproduce total energies, atomization energies, and dipole moments obtained from ``quasi-exact'' multiwavelet results. Undesirably large errors were observed for the correlation consistent basis sets. One of the papers argued that basis sets specifically optimized for DFT methods were ``essential'' for obtaining high accuracy. In this work we reexamined the performance of the correlation consistent basis sets by resolving problems with the previous calculations and by making more appropriate basis set choices for the alkali and alkaline-earth metals and second-row elements. When this is done, the statistical errors with respect to the benchmark values and with respect to DFT optimized basis sets are greatly reduced, especially in light of the relatively large intrinsic error of the underlying DFT method. When judged with respect to high-quality Feller-Peterson-Dixon coupled cluster theory atomization energies, the PBE0 DFT method used in the previous studies exhibits a mean absolute deviation more than a factor of 50 larger than the quintuple zeta basis set truncation error.},

Theory Comput. 2010, 6, 107], which is dubbed GMTKN30. Furthermore, we suggest and investigate two new double-hybrid-meta-GGA density functionals called PTPSS-D3 and PWPB95-D3. PTPSS-D3 is based on reparameterized TPSS exchange and correlation contributions; PWPB95D3 contains reparameterized PW exchange and B95 parts. Both functionals contain fixed amounts of 50\% Fock-exchange. Furthermore, they include a spin-opposite scaled perturbative contribution and are combined with our latest atom-pairwise London-dispersion correction [J. Chem. Phys. 2010, 132, 154104]. When evaluated with the help of the Laplace transformation algorithm, both methods scale as N4 with system size. The functionals are compared with the double hybrids B2PLYP-D3, B2GPPLYP-D3, DSD-BLYP-D3, and XYG3 for GMTKN30 with a quadruple-{$\zeta$} basis set. PWPB95-D3 and DSD-BLYP-D3 are the best functionals in our study and turned out to be more robust than B2PLYP-D3 and XYG3. Furthermore, PWPB95-D3 is the least basis set dependent and the best functional at the triple-{$\zeta$} level. For the example of transition metal carbonyls, it is shown that, mainly due to the lower amount of Fock-exchange, PWPB95-D3 and PTPSS-D3 are better applicable than the other double hybrids. Finally, we discuss in some detail the XYG3 functional [Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009, 106, 4963], which makes use of B3LYP orbitals and electron densities. We show that it is basically a highly nonlocal variant of B2PLYP and that its partially good performance is mainly due to a larger effective amount of perturbative correlation compared to other double hybrids. We finally recommend the PWPB95-D3 functional in general chemistry applications.},

GMTKN55 comprises 1505 relative energies based on 2462 single-point calculations and it is accessible to the user community               via               a dedicated website. Herein, we demonstrate the importance of better reference values, and we re-emphasise the need for London-dispersion corrections in density functional theory (DFT) treatments of thermochemical problems, including Minnesota methods. We assessed 217 variations of dispersion-corrected and -uncorrected density functional approximations, and carried out a detailed analysis of 83 of them to identify robust and reliable approaches. Double-hybrid functionals are the most reliable approaches for thermochemistry and noncovalent interactions, and they should be used whenever technically feasible. These are, in particular, DSD-BLYP-D3(BJ), DSD-PBEP86-D3(BJ), and B2GPPLYP-D3(BJ). The best hybrids are {$\omega$}B97X-V, M052X-D3(0), and {$\omega$}B97X-D3, but we also recommend PW6B95-D3(BJ) as the best conventional global hybrid. At the meta-generalised-gradient (meta-GGA) level, the SCAN-D3(BJ) method can be recommended. Other meta-GGAs are outperformed by the GGA functionals revPBE-D3(BJ), B97-D3(BJ), and OLYP-D3(BJ). We note that many popular methods, such as B3LYP, are not part of our recommendations. In fact, with our results we hope to inspire a change in the user community's perception of common DFT methods. We also encourage method developers to use GMTKN55 for cross-validation studies of new methodologies.},

  abstract = {A new hybrid density functional for general chemistry applications is proposed. It is based on a mixing of standard generalized gradient approximations (GGAs) for exchange by Becke (B) and for correlation by Lee, Yang, and Parr (LYP) with Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange and a perturbative second-order correlation part (PT2) that is obtained from the Kohn-Sham (GGA) orbitals and eigenvalues. This virtual orbital-dependent functional contains only two global parameters that describe the mixture of HF and GGA exchange (a(x)) and of the PT2 and GGA correlation (c), respectively. The parameters are obtained in a least-squares-fit procedure to the G297 set of heat of formations. Opposed to conventional hybrid functionals, the optimum a(x) is found to be quite large (53\% with c=27\%) which at least in part explains the success for many problematic molecular systems compared to conventional approaches. The performance of the new functional termed B2-PLYP is assessed by the G297 standard benchmark set, a second test suite of atoms, molecules, and reactions that are considered as electronically very difficult (including transition-metal compounds, weakly bonded complexes, and reaction barriers) and comparisons with other hybrid functionals of GGA and meta-GGA types. According to many realistic tests, B2-PLYP can be regarded as the best general purpose density functional for molecules (e.g., a mean absolute deviation for the two test sets of only 1.8 and 3.2 kcal/mol compared to about 3 and 5 kcal/mol, respectively, for the best other density functionals). Very importantly, also the maximum and minimum errors (outliers) are strongly reduced (by about 10-20 kcal/mol). Furthermore, very good results are obtained for transition state barriers but unlike previous attempts at such a good description, this definitely comes not at the expense of equilibrium properties. Preliminary calculations of the equilibrium bond lengths and harmonic vibrational frequencies for diatomic molecules and transition-metal complexes also show very promising results. The uniformity with which B2-PLYP improves for a wide range of chemical systems emphasizes the need of (virtual) orbital-dependent terms that describe nonlocal electron correlation in accurate exchange-correlation functionals. From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be very robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient quantum chemical method of general purpose.},

  abstract = {It is shown by an extensive benchmark on molecular energy data that the mathematical form of the damping function in DFT-D methods has only a minor impact on the quality of the results. For 12 different functionals, a standard ``zero-damping'' formula and rational damping to finite values for small interatomic distances according to Becke and Johnson (BJ-damping) has been tested. The same (DFT-D3) scheme for the computation of the dispersion coefficients is used. The BJ-damping requires one fit parameter more for each functional (three instead of two) but has the advantage of avoiding repulsive interatomic forces at shorter distances. With BJ-damping better results for nonbonded distances and more clear effects of intramolecular dispersion in four representative molecular structures are found. For the noncovalentlybonded structures in the S22 set, both schemes lead to very similar intermolecular distances. For noncovalent interaction energies BJ-damping performs slightly better but both variants can be recommended in general. The exception to this is Hartree-Fock that can be recommended only in the BJ-variant and which is then close to the accuracy of corrected GGAs for non-covalent interactions. According to the thermodynamic benchmarks BJ-damping is more accurate especially for medium-range electron correlation problems and only small and practically insignificant double-counting effects are observed. It seems to provide a physically correct short-range behavior of correlation/dispersion even with unmodified standard functionals. In any case, the differences between the two methods are much smaller than the overall dispersion effect and often also smaller than the influence of the underlying density functional.},

  abstract = {Mean-field electronic structure methods like Hartree-Fock, semilocal density functional approximations, or semiempirical molecular orbital (MO) theories do not account for long-range electron correlation (London dispersion interaction). Inclusion of these effects is mandatory for realistic calculations on large or condensed chemical systems and for various intramolecular phenomena (thermochemistry). This Review describes the recent developments (including some historical aspects) of dispersion corrections with an emphasis on methods that can be employed routinely with reasonable accuracy in large-scale applications. The most prominent correction schemes are classified into three groups: (i) nonlocal, density-based functionals, (ii) semiclassical C6-based, and (iii) one-electron effective potentials. The properties as well as pros and cons of these methods are critically discussed, and typical examples and benchmarks on molecular complexes and crystals are provided. Although there are some areas for further improvement (robustness, many-body and short-range effects), the situation regarding the overall accuracy is clear. Various approaches yield long-range dispersion energies with a typical relative error of 5\%. For many chemical problems, this accuracy is higher compared to that of the underlying mean-field method (i.e., a typical semilocal (hybrid) functional like B3LYP).},

In order to do so, we introduce a new nomenclature to unambiguously indicate how a CBS extrapolation was computed. Nineteen minima and transition states of buta-1,3-diene, propan-2-ol and the water dimer were optimized using 45 different basis sets. Specifically, this includes one Pople (i.e. 6-31G(d)), 8 Dunning (i.e. VXZ and AVXZ, X = 2\textendash 5), 25 Jensen (i.e. pc-n, pcseg-n, aug-pcseg-n, pcSseg-n, and aug-pcSseg-n, n = 0\textendash 4), and 9 Karlsruhe (e.g. def2-SV(P), def2-QZVPPD) basis sets. The molecules were chosen to represent both common and electronically diverse molecular systems. In comparison to MP2/CBS relative energies computed using the largest Jensen basis sets (i.e. n = 2,3,4), the use of smaller sizes (n = 0,1,2 and n = 1,2,3) provides results that are within 0.11\textendash 0.24 and 0.09\textendash 0.16 kcal \'A mol\`A1. To practically guide researchers in their basis set choice, an equation is introduced that ranks basis sets based on a user-defined balance between their accuracy and calculation cost. Furthermore, we explain why the aug-pcseg-2, def2-TZVPPD and def2-TZVP basis sets are very suitable choices to balance speed and accuracy.},

The experiments are supported by a wide array of highly accurate calculations, expanding the analysis to the complexes of He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, and Hg with OCS. We investigate the trends in the structures and binding energies of the complexes. The assumption that the structure of the monomers does not change significantly upon forming a weakly bound complex is also tested. An attempt at reproducing the               r               (2)m structure of the Xe{$\cdots$}OCS complex with correlated wavefunction theory is made, highlighting the importance of relativistic effects, large basis sets, and inclusion of diffuse functions in extrapolation recipes.},

The most commonly used approach for all-electron electronic structure calculations in general\textemdash the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) method\textemdash is discussed in combination with Gaussian, Slater a.k.a. exponential, and numerical radial functions. Even though LCAO calculations have major benefits, their shortcomings motivate the need for fully numerical approaches based on, for example, finite differences, finite elements, or the discrete variable representation, which are also briefly introduced. Applications of fully numerical approaches for general molecules are briefly reviewed, and their challenges are discussed. It is pointed out that the high level of symmetry present in atoms and diatomic molecules can be exploited to fashion more efficient fully numerical approaches for these special cases, after which it is possible to routinely perform allelectron Hartree-Fock and density functional calculations directly at the basis set limit on such systems. Applications of fully numerical approaches to calculations on atoms as well as diatomic molecules are reviewed. Finally, a summary and outlook is given.},

  abstract = {For a set of eight equilibrium intermolecular complexes, it is discovered that the basis set limit (BSL) cannot be reached by augcc-pV5Z for three of the Minnesota density functionals: M06-L, M06HF, and M11-L. In addition, the M06 and M11 functionals exhibit substantial, but less severe, difficulties in reaching the BSL. By using successively finer grids, it is demonstrated that this issue is not related to the numerical integration of the exchange-correlation functional. In addition, it is shown that the difficulty in reaching the BSL is not a direct consequence of the structure of the augmented functions in Dunning's basis sets, since modified augmentation yields similar results. By using a very large custom basis set, the BSL appears to be reached for the HF dimer for all of the functionals. As a result, it is concluded that the difficulties faced by several of the Minnesota density functionals are related to an interplay between the form of these functionals and the structure of standard basis sets. It is speculated that the difficulty in reaching the basis set limit is related to the magnitude of the inhomogeneity correction factor (ICF) of the exchange functional. A simple modification of the M06-L exchange functional that systematically reduces the basis set superposition error (BSSE) for the HF dimer in the aug-ccpVQZ basis set is presented, further supporting the speculation that the difficulty in reaching the BSL is caused by the magnitude of the exchange functional ICF. Finally, the BSSE is plotted with respect to the internuclear distance of the neon dimer for two of the examined functionals.},

We show that such ``root-exponential'' convergence patterns are a consequence of the orbital cusps at r = 0, rather than the over-rapid decay of Gaussians at large r. We find that even-tempered expansions of the cuspless Lorentzian orbital also exhibit root-exponential convergence but that this is a consequence of its fat tail.},

  abstract = {The development of van der Waals density functional approximations (vdW-DFAs) has gained considerable interest over the past decade. While in a strictest sense, energy calculations with vdW-DFAs should be carried out fully self-consistently, we demonstrate conclusively for a total of 11 methods that such a strategy only increases the computational time effort without having any significant effect on energetic properties, electron densities, or orbital-energy differences. The strategy to apply a nonlocal vdW-DFA kernel as an additive correction to a fully converged conventional DFA result is therefore justified and more efficient. As part of our study, we utilize the extensive GMTKN55 database for general main-group thermochemistry, kinetics, and noncovalent interactions [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2017, 19, 32184], which allows us to analyze the very promising B97M-V [J. Chem. Phys. 2015, 142, 074111] and {$\omega$}B97M-V [J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 144, 214110] DFAs. We also present new DFT-D3(BJ) based counterparts of these two methods and of {$\omega$}B97X-V [J. Chem. Theory Comput 2013, 9, 263], which are faster variants with similar accuracy. Our study concludes with updated recommendations for the general method user, based on our current overview of 325 dispersion-corrected and -uncorrected DFA variants analyzed for GMTKN55. vdW-DFAs are the best representatives of the three highest rungs of Jacob's Ladder, namely, B97M-V, {$\omega$}B97M-V, and DSD-PBEP86-NL.},

The stability of the scintillator constituents was determined through fluorescence excitation emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy and absorption spectroscopy, using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) as an multivariate analysis tool. By exposing the scintillator liquid to a well-known photon flux at 365 nm and by measuring the decay rate of the fluorescence shifters and the formation rate of their photochemical degradation products, we can place an upper limit on the acceptable photon flux as 1.38 {$\pm$} 0.09 \texttimes{} 10               -11               photon mol L               -1               .

Here, benchmark complete-basis set coupled cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples (CCSD(T)) calculations have been performed to generate a new test set for three-body intermolecular interactions. This ``3B-69'' benchmark set includes three-body interaction energies for 69 total trimer structures, consisting of three structures from each of 23 different molecular crystals. By including structures that exhibit a variety of intermolecular interactions and packing arrangements, this set provides a stringent test for the ability of electronic structure methods to describe the correct physics involved in the interactions. Both MP2.5 (the average of second- and third-order M\o ller-Plesset perturbation theory) and spin-componentscaled CCSD for noncovalent interactions (SCS-MI-CCSD) perform well. MP2 handles the polarization aspects reasonably well, but it omits three-body dispersion. In contrast, many widely used density functionals corrected with three-body D3 dispersion correction perform comparatively poorly. The primary difficulty stems from the treatment of exchange and polarization in the functionals rather than from the dispersion correction, though the three-body dispersion may also be moderately underestimated by the D3 correction.},

A 2012, 116, 11668] emphasized the importance of core-electron correlation effects to describe the Si2H6BH3 complex and related systems properly. Unexpected large energy differences between a frozen core and all electron treatment were observed. In the present study, it will be shown that these energy differences are an artifact of an insufficient choice of basis set and can be attributed to an intramolecular basis set superposition error (BSSE). Although the general problem is known, systematic studies on the effect are scarce. Therefore, the BSSE in related systems is investigated. This study shows that the problem of BSSE for core-electron correlation is quite common if inadequate basis sets are applied and that it amounts to 2 kcal mol-1 on average in binding energies for the given test set (with a maximum of 5.8 kcal mol-1).},

  abstract = {Because the one-electron basis set limit is difficult to reach in correlated postHartree\textendash Fock ab initio calculations, the low-cost route of using methods that extrapolate to the estimated basis set limit attracts immediate interest. The situation is somewhat more satisfactory at the Hartree\textendash Fock level because numerical calculation of the energy is often affordable at nearly converged basis set levels. Still, extrapolation schemes for the Hartree\textendash Fock energy are addressed here, although the focus is on the more slowly convergent and computationally demanding correlation energy. Because they are frequently based on the gold-standard coupled-cluster theory with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)], correlated calculations are often affordable only with the smallest basis sets, and hence single-level extrapolations from one raw energy could attain maximum usefulness. This possibility is examined. Whenever possible, this review uses raw data from second-order M\o ller\textendash Plesset perturbation theory, as well as CCSD, CCSD(T), and multireference configuration interaction methods. Inescapably, the emphasis is on work done by the author's research group. Certain issues in need of further research or review are pinpointed.},

Unprecedentedly, it can be reliably extrapolated to the complete basis set limit (CBS) from as small as Pople's STO-2G up to the largest aug-cc-pV               X               Z basis sets of Dunning's correlation-consistent type and even more complete variants of such ansatzes. The approach is tested on a panoply of small, medium and large molecular systems. As a case study, extrapolation is shown to be particularly reliable and cost-effective (typically an order of magnitude more economical for similar accuracy) when employing a hybrid (STO-2G,extended) basis set pair. The additional cost relative to a single-point calculation with the extended basis set is of no significance. After training the novel scheme with a meager set of 18 systems (TS-18), four test sets covering from neutrals (TS-105) to neutrals plus cations (TS-26) and anions (TS-17), these involving up to third-row elements, as well as tetrapeptide conformers (TS-10) were utilized for its validation. Although the answer to the question of whether all basis sets converge to the same HF/CBS limit is a clear yes, that of whether they show the same convergence rate is open, an issue also examined in the present work. For systems involving atoms up to the second-row of the periodic table the answer seems to be a clear yes, at least when using correlation-consistent basis sets, but it is shown to be a no when the study is extended to anionic systems containing third-row elements. For the latter, augmented correlation consistent basis sets display a faster, perhaps optimal, convergence rate. The implications of this in practice can hardly be anticipated. For example, it cannot be predicted               a priori               which of such basis sets will yield the best relative energies for those anions, although a logical expectation suggests it to be the augmented ones which turn out to display the fastest convergence. As a blind-test type illustration, the novel scheme is applied to the conformational analysis of 2 tetrapeptides with 5 conformers each, using from subminimal up to extended basis sets as large as cc-pV5Z and aug-cc-pV               Q               Z. The (STO-2G,extended) results so obtained are predicted to be in very good agreement with the best data reported thus far.},

The new functional is considerably simpler than its predecessors of a similar type. The functional has a tractable and robust analytic form that lends itself to efficient self-consistent implementation. When paired with an appropriate exchange functional, our nonlocal correlation model yields accurate interaction energies of weakly-bound complexes, not only near the energy minima but also far from equilibrium. Our model exhibits an outstanding precision at predicting equilibrium intermonomer separations in van der Waals complexes. It also gives accurate covalent bond lengths and atomization energies. Hence the functional proposed in this work is a computationally inexpensive electronic structure tool of broad applicability.},

  abstract = {The focal-point approach, combining several quantum chemistry computations to estimate a more accurate computation at a lower expense, is effective and commonly used for energies. However, it has not yet been widely adopted for properties such as geometries. Here, we examine several focal-point methods combining M\o ller\textendash Plesset perturbation theory (MP2 and MP2.5) with coupled-cluster theory through perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] for their effectiveness in geometry optimizations using a new driver for the PSI4 electronic structure program that efficiently automates the computation of composite-energy gradients. The test set consists of 94 closed-shell molecules containing firstand/or second-row elements. The focal-point methods utilized combinations of correlation-consistent basis sets cc-pV(X+d)Z and heavyaug-cc-pV(X+d)Z (X = D, T, Q, 5, 6). Focal-point geometries were compared to those from conventional CCSD(T) using basis sets up to heavy-aug-cc-pV5Z and to geometries from explicitly correlated CCSD(T)-F12 using the cc-pVXZ-F12 (X = D, T) basis sets. All results were compared to reference geometries reported by Karton et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 145, 104101 (2016)] at the CCSD(T)/heavy-aug-cc-pV6Z level of theory. In general, focal-point methods based on an estimate of the MP2 complete-basis-set limit, with a coupled-cluster correction evaluated in a (heavy-aug-)cc-pVXZ basis, are of superior quality to conventional CCSD(T)/(heavy-aug-)cc-pV(X+1)Z and sometimes approach the errors of CCSD(T)/(heavy-aug-)cc-pV(X+2)Z. However, the focal-point methods are much faster computationally. For the benzene molecule, the gradient of such a focal-point approach requires only 4.5\% of the computation time of a conventional CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ gradient and only 0.4\% of the time of a CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ gradient.},

We also provide a full discussion of the new M05 functional, previously presented in a short communication. The M05 functional was parametrized including both metals and nonmetals, whereas M05-2X is a highnonlocality functional with double the amount of nonlocal exchange (2X) that is parametrized only for nonmetals. In particular, M05 was parametrized against 35 data values, and M05-2X is parametrized against 34 data values. Both functionals, along with 28 other functionals, have been comparatively assessed against 234 data values: the MGAE109/3 main-group atomization energy database, the IP13/3 ionization potential database, the EA13/3 electron affinity database, the HTBH38/4 database of barrier height for hydrogen-transfer reactions, five noncovalent databases, two databases involving metal-metal and metal-ligand bond energies, a dipole moment database, a database of four alkyl bond dissociation energies of alkanes and ethers, and three total energies of one-electron systems. We also tested the new functionals and 12 others for eight hydrogen-bonding and stacking interaction energies in nucleobase pairs, and we tested M05 and M05-2X and 19 other functionals for the geometry, dipole moment, and binding energy of HCN-BF3, which has recently been shown to be a very difficult case for density functional theory. We tested eight functionals for four more alkyl bond dissociation energies, and we tested 12 functionals for several additional bond energies with varying amounts of multireference character. On the basis of all the results for 256 data values in 18 databases in the present study, we recommend M05-2X, M05, PW6B95, PWB6K, and MPWB1K for generalpurpose applications in thermochemistry, kinetics, and noncovalent interactions involving nonmetals and we recommend M05 for studies involving both metallic and nonmetallic elements. The M05 functional, essentially uniquely among the functionals with broad applicability to chemistry, also performs well not only for main-group thermochemistry and radical reaction barrier heights but also for transition-metal-transition-metal interactions. The M05-2X functional has the best performance for thermochemical kinetics, noncovalent interactions (especially weak interaction, hydrogen bonding, {$\pi$},,,{$\pi$} stacking, and interactions energies of nucleobases), and alkyl bond dissociation energies and the best composite results for energetics, excluding metals.},
